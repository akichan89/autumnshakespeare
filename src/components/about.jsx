                      <p>
Let me tell you a little bit about myself: I am a hard worker,
determined, and love to live a positive life. I completed a Full Stack
Web Development (Python+React) Certification and graduating with
an Associates in Computer Science from Bottega University and
working towards a Bachelor's in Computer Science from Western
Governor's University. I am a self trained IT Professional, with a
previous CompTIA A+ certification. With over seven years of tech and
software related experience, I am capable of problem solving, self
study and quality work consistent with a growth mindset. This
determination assists in delivering nothing less than a quality ; which
is how I would exceed expectations at your company.

                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I am also a very fun, upbeat, perky young woman that can
                        add to the already happy environment you have. As if
                        that werenâ€™t enough, I can put a smile on any face!
                        I would be an asset to your company!!
