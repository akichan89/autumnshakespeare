                      <p>
                        Let me tell you a little bit about myself: I am a hard
                        worker, determined, and love to live a positive life. I
                        am Griffin Hill trained as well as CompTIA A+ certified
                        which has made me very successful at making long time
                        customers and money for companies. What this means for
                        you and your company is: I will be a productive employee
                        that will bring in revenue while making the customers
                        feel comfortable and like I care about their needs, all
                        while exceeding their expectations. Therefore, your
                        company will have lifelong customers that will recommend
                        you to their friends and family.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I am also a very fun, upbeat, perky young woman that can
                        add to the already happy environment you have. As if
                        that werenâ€™t enough, I can put a smile on anyone's face!
                        I would be an asset to your company!!
