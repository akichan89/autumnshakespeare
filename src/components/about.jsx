                      <p>
                        Let me tell you a little bit about myself: I am a hard
                        worker, determined, and love to live a positive life. I
                        am CompTIA A+ Certified with a Full Stack Web Development Certificate from Bottega University. I am also currently pursuing
      my Bachelor Degree in Computer Science from WGU. What this means for
                        you and your company is: I will be a productive employee
                        that will bring creative, high-quality, production-ready code to every code commit. Therefore, I will contribute to your
                        company in delivering an equally high-quality product for your market, tailored to your needs. 
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I am also a very fun, upbeat, perky young woman that can
                        add to the already happy environment you have. As if
                        that werenâ€™t enough, I can put a smile on any face!
                        I would be an asset to your company!!
